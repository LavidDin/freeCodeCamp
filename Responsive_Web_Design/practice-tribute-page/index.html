        <p> <q>Our team treats our players the same as if they were professional athletes, because that's what they are. We monitor all aspects of their training and preparation, all the way down to their nutrition, fitness and sleep. We supply them with the best coaches in the industry and offer them a state-of-the-art training facility. We do that because, quite simply, it's what's required in order to compete for championships.</q></p>
